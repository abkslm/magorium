# magorium
Magorium is an agent that organizes toy/game store inventories for optimal shelving and e-commerce categorization.

Magorium was made for [MOORE Toys & Gadgets, Inc](https://mooretoys.com) (that's my mom!). It was designed solely with MTG's requirements in mind and may or may not be appropriate for other businesses's use.

This project's name is a reference to the 2007 movie, *Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium*.
